# [v4.1.0](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web/tree/v4.1.0)

## Features
- Custom resources / grammar support, upload your custom grammar to modify the recognition behaviour (see the [example](./examples/v4/custom_resources.html)).
- New `penStyleClasses` property. Used to change the theme using classes passed using the `theme` property (see the [example](./examples/non-version-specific/customize_style.html)).
- No more css background if api is set to `V4`.
- No more STIX font import needed as the font is now rendered by the server.
- New `usepointerlisteners` property used to force the pointer events use.

## Breaking changes
In order to be consistent with the native API :
- `importContent()` and `exportContent()` respectively renamed to `import_()` and `export_()`.
- `importInk(strokes)` changed to `pointerEvents(events)`.

## Bug fixed

- Math exports rendering for breaking line was printing \\\\ and not breaking line.

# [v4.0.1](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web/tree/v4.0.1)

# [v4.0.0](https://github.com/MyScript/myscript-math-web/tree/v4.0.0)

## Features
- New events to be notified of editor changes. 
- New `unloaded` flag to control component state. `load` event will be trigger once the editor will be fully loaded.
- New **not mutable** `configuration` attribute. Changing the configuration will clear the underlying editor, all currents strokes and results will be lost. To do it, set `unloaded=true` after changing configuration, and wait for a `load` event.
- New **read-only** `editor` property that allow you to access to the underlying editor object (see [MyScriptJS documentation]() for more details).
- New CSS variables to customize the web-component. See [demo/styling.html](demo/styling.html) as an example.
 
## Breaking changes
- Complete rewrite of the underlying javascript library with ES6 syntax
- Internal design improved to allow extensibility and support of upcoming recognition types. Documentation and illustrating samples to come in next release. 
- Removal of all deprecated attributes and methods
- All events has been renamed. See the [documentation](docs/index.html) to discover new behavior.
- `resulttypes`, `language`, `typeset`, `textparameters`, `mathparameters`, `shapeparameters`, `musicparameters`, `analyzerparameters` are replaced by the unique `configuration` attribute (see [MyScriptJS documentation]() for a complete spec).
- Renamed `timeout` attribute to `recognitiontriggerdelay`
- Renamed `delete()` property to `clear()`
- Changed `ssl` attribute to a `scheme` attribute (i.e. `ssl=true` will be replaced by `scheme=https`)
- `getAvailableLanguages()` have been replaced by a new web-component. You can use it to retrieve the list of available languages for your configuration.

##Â Bugs
